This project is an interactive gallery showcasing a collection of cinematic camera movements, designed to educate and visually demonstrate fundamental filmmaking techniques in a dynamic way. Each movement, such as "Pan," "Tilt," or "Dolly," is illustrated with a continuously running animation, paired with a brief description and an iconic example of its use in classic films. Technically, the project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a responsive design based on CSS Grid to adapt seamlessly across devices. Animations are implemented with CSS Keyframes for smooth performance, while JavaScript handles interactivity, including language switching (EN, ES, FR, IT, DE) and dynamic header color changes on scroll, ensuring an immersive and accessible user experience on both desktop and mobile.
